# kivy_screen_example
A simple toy application to demonstrate basic usage of Kivy screens.


# To run this application

 - Clone this directory.
 - Make sure you have Python 3 installed, any version at least as high as Python 3.4. ([Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3112/) is the latest version as of this writing. If you're on Windows, you very likely will need the 64-bit installer.)
 - Ensure that Python is added to your `PATH` environment variable. (On Windows, there will be a checkbox on the installer to add Python to your path. If you forgot to check this box, the app is almost certainly found at C:\Users\\<your_user_name\>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python.)
 - In the command line, go to whatever you cloned this directory and execute `pip install kivy`. (If you installed a version of Python 3 before version 3.4, then you will have to [install pip manually](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)).
 - In that same directory, execute `python kivy_screen_example.py`.

While the app is running, press Ctrl + e to bring up the Kivy inspector.
